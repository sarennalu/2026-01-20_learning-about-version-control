# Learning About Version Control
Sarenna Ulman

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

The thing I like most about version control is how traceable it is, especially being able to trace back different commits and see exactly what changes are made.
Something that I find confusing about version control is merge conflicts and how to best resolve them.
